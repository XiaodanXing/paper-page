# paper-page
A simple tool to create a new github page for your papers

If you would like to promote your paper by webpages like [this](phillipi.github.io/pix2pix/), and you don't know nothing about HTML formatting, then this resporitory is right for you!

Based on the format from [pix2pix](phillipi.github.io/pix2pix/), paper-page used a python file to convert the attributes from the [configuration file]() to an html file. And this html file can be added directly to your github resporitories alongside with all your codes, and can be compiled into a webpage related to your paper!

## Step 1. Create a HTML file
1. Clone this resporitory in your pc by
```
git clone
